The .NET SDK for Azure libraries all support [.NET Framework](/dotnet/articles/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).  .NET Core support is provided by most packages.  Verify .NET Core support by checking for a *.NETStandard* dependency, as seen with [WindowsAzure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage). Some of these packages are in preview, requiring you to opt into search and installation of preview NuGet packages.

## Running the samples

Once you have used Git to clone the sample, you can open the sample in Visual Studio and run the sample using the IDE.  Alternatively, use the .NET Core SDK to build and run the sample from the command line, like this:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-dotnet-configure-deployment-sources-for-web-apps.git
cd app-service-dotnet-configure-deployment-sources-for-web-apps
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

# Get started with .NET for Azure developers

This tutorial will walk you through building and deploying your first application in Microsoft Azure.  Upon completing this walkthrough, you'll have a web-based to-do application built in ASP.NET, hosted as an Azure Web App, and using Azure DocumentDB for data storage.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* A [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* A [DocumentDB account](/azure/documentdb/documentdb-create-account) in your Azure subscription (an empty account is fine, you don't need to create a collection)
* The [URI and access key](/azure/documentdb/documentdb-manage-account#a-idkeysaview-copy-and-regenerate-access-keys) belonging to your DocumentDB account
